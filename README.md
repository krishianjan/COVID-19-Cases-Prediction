The aim of this project is to develop a deep neural network (DNN) model using PyTorch to predict the percentage of new COVID-19 cases on the 3rd day based on survey results from the past days in various states across the USA. 
The model uses features such as previous days' percentages of tested positive cases to forecast future trends, which can help in understanding and managing the spread of the virus. 
--> this project is built up on Google colab , with GPU's. I suggest to run on google colab . IF you want to run on any other Environments kindly follow below instructions :

--> Kindly Download datasets and then upload them to your content in colab then run them 

--> I have provided code for the upload also please feel free to use them

--> For downloading datasets link : https://github.com/AnneZhang13/INFO536/blob/main/project1/covid.test.csv

--> Save the code frequently to avoid the reconnecting issues from collab.

---> For fimal code and model drag to the bottom and verify from there i have kept a markdown like FINAL CODE , MODEL, VISUALIZATIONS 

--> The predictions are being saved as csv and can be downloaded to your folder for better understanding
